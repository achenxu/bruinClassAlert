Have you ever had trouble enrolling in the classes at UCLA you want? I believe everyone has experienced this frustration. Some people would check the registrar constantly, which is very annoying. Don't you wish there's an app out there that can do this task repeatedly every 20 seconds? I know there are websites like course ninja and classscanner that do similar things. However, the problem with those applications is that they are unable to constantly check the enrollment status due to limited server loads.
