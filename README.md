Bruin Class Alert
================
A very hand app that allows UCLA students to track down classes and be alerted when they are open!

Why this?
------------
Have you ever had trouble enrolling in the classes you want at UCLA? The level of frustration that this could lead to is tremendous. Sometimes, if we are lucky we could get in but most of the time, it's impossible. Having to check the registrar website repeatedly everyday is annoying. Don't you wish there's an app out there that can do this task repeatedly every 20 seconds? I know there are websites like course ninja and classscanner (which are great applications) that do similar things. However, the problem with those applications is that they are unable to constantly check the enrollment status due to limited server loads. This light-weight python script allows you to  add any any number of classes you want and be alerted in text or email.



Installation
------------
1.  Clone or download the repo

2.  Set up the correct contact (email/phone) information in setting.py

3.  Add the classes you want to target in setting.py (make sure to follow the template format)
